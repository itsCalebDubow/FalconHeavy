Rob:
    We have the Game working out of GameViewController for the most part
    touch functions are hard to work with if we are using a seperate scene with a 2D overlay which lets us put the controls in
    The problem that Wendel and I are facing is making the rocket move in response to gyoscope movement. We have attempted to use trig but the 3D aspect is making it hard to use.

    The code that Wendel sent me for some reason doesnt contain GameView.Swift. The only thing that is in it is the 2D sprites and overlays that are seen when looking at the screen. You can ask Wendel for the file.

    Lots of the code that Wendel put in is code that I am very unfamiliar with. He is working out of a book for SCNKit and insists on using that format. You can text me if you have any questions with the code.

    Check GameviewController for more info abt the bug

Delete this when you push this back to me :)
